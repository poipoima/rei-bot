# Discord Rei Bot

A Discord bot with a flexible migration system and hot-reloading support.  

## Features

- **Database Migrations**  
  Built-in migration system that lets you easily add or remove parameters, tables, and schema changes.  

- **ORM Support**  
  Uses [Orator](https://github.com/sdispater/orator/) (an Eloquent-like ORM), so you can work with the database through clean, object-oriented models instead of raw SQL.  

- **Hot Reloading**  
  Update your code in real time! No need to restart the bot, changes are automatically reloaded while the bot is running.  

- **Cog System**  
  Fully supports standard Discord cogs without requiring cog's setup functions.  

- **AI Rei Cog**  
  Includes a special cog where the bot roleplays as **Ayanami Rei** from *Neon Genesis Evangelion* ðŸ¤–âœ¨

## Also
  All the changes to the main branch also applies to the bot that is running on my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/tUZzEH5H9U), so, you can play with it :D
  It updates automatically, just make a commit, i will look at it and merge, that's all it takes.
